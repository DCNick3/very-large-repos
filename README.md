This tool uses github API to search for non-archived rust repositories with >10 stars and >10 commits, sorted by size.

Due to the sorting, there are a lot of repos that do not really have a lot in terms of rust code, instead opting to have a bunch of binary files to bring up the size.

Therefore, we check (also using github API) whether the rust takes majority of the space in the latest commit.

Why aren't we using a more sensible sorting? Don't ask me ðŸ¤¡

It takes about 1.5 hours to run this script. It needs a `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable set and will write the results into `repo-list.txt` file.
